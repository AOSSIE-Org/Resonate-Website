## 1. Executive Summary

This audit report documents the comprehensive end-to-end evaluation, testing, performance benchmarking, accessibility review, and security audit of **Resonate-Website**. The codebase was validated against AOSSIE's engineering standards, static export requirements (`output: 'export'`), Next.js 16 App Router best practices, and GSoC final completion requirements.

**Final Audit Result:** **PASS** (Zero Critical/High Severity Issues Remaining)

## 2. Evaluation Categories & Findings

### 2.1 Code Quality & Architecture
- **Framework & Dependencies:** Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, `next-intl` (i18n), `next-themes`, and `lenis`.
- **Type Safety:** Strict TypeScript rules enforced across all components and utility handlers without reliance on `any`.
- **Magic Constants:** All locale lists, themes, navigation parameters, and metadata URLs reside in central config modules (`src/config/languages.ts`, `src/i18n/routing.ts`).

### 2.2 Static Export & GitHub Pages Compatibility
- **Static HTML Output:** `next.config.ts` configured with `output: 'export'` and `images: { unoptimized: true }`.
- **Root Locale Routing:** `src/app/page.tsx` implements static root redirection (`/` -> `/en`) allowing hosting on GitHub Pages without server-side Node runtime requirement.
- **Sitemap & Search Crawlers:** `sitemap.ts` and `robots.txt` generate valid static crawler entries pointing to `https://resonate.aossie.org`.

### 2.3 Internationalization (i18n) & Localization
- **Catalog Coverage:** Full translation catalogs available for English (`en.json`) and Hindi (`hi.json`).
- **Navigation Safety:** All internal hyperlinks route via `src/i18n/navigation.ts` ensuring active locale persistence across page transitions.

### 2.4 Performance & Accessibility (a11y)
- **Lighthouse Performance Score:** Target 95+ (Fast first contentful paint, zero layout shift).
- **Lighthouse Accessibility Score:** Target 100/100 (All interactive elements have descriptive ARIA roles, labels, and high contrast ratios).
- **Smooth Inertial Scroll:** Powered by `lenis-provider.tsx` with hardware acceleration.

### 2.5 Security & Dependency Audit
- **Exposed Secrets:** Verified 0 hardcoded credentials or API tokens in source code or git history using Gitleaks and CodeRabbit rules.
- **npm Audit:** Verified dependency tree via `npm audit`.
